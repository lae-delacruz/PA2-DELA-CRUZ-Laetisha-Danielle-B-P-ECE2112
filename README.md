PA2 DELA CRUZ, Laetisha Danielle B [P-ECE2112]

*This repository contains the Jupyter notebook for PA2* 


This notebook demonstrates the various functions and uses of the Numpy library in Python

### PROBLEM #1: NORMALIZATION PROBLEM
- In this problem, a random 5 x 5 ndarray and storeed it to variable X. Normalize X. This was done through the use of built-in function 'np.random.random'
- It was then saved as X_normalized.npy and loaded in the next line using np.load
- The code successfully ran the normalized array and its mean and std

### PROBLEM 2: DIVISIBLE BY THREE
- A 10 x 10 array containing the square of the first 100 integers using functions such as np.arange, a.reshape, np.square.
- It was saved as div_by_3.npy and loaded at the next line as np.load
- The code successfully ran the first 100 squared integers which are divided by 3
